We charge travel at $1.50 per Km (return).  We base travel off Google Maps, or similar, to determine road travel distance.

When drone crews are working on jobs that are across multiple days outside our Oberon base, overnight accommodation fees will need to be charged. This will be
discussed prior to commencement of the job.
