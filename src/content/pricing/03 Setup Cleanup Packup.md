$150 per SCP will be added to your invoice for these peripheral but necessary activities. If there are multiple paddocks/properties, additional SCP fees will be charged as the crew will need to move their equipment and map each area. When contacting us for a quote, be sure to advise how many different areas you are needing treated, and the distance between each one.
  
## Charges that may be applicable:
**Additional Costs for Complex Chemicals**  
Where three or more chemicals are required to be mixed, an additional charge of $3/Ha will be applied (per extra chemical). Where powdered or granular chemicals need to be dispersed in water, an additional $3/Ha will also apply.  
  
**Task Complexity Fee**  
Drone Commander Australia reserves the right to charge an additional fee based on factors impacting the complexity of the operation. This includes but is not limited to factors such as terrain, obstacles and livestock in the direct area of application. Drone Commander will communicate with you should this additional fee of $80 per additional hour be necessary.
