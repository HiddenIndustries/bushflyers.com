We have a per Hectare rate, an hourly rate, and a ground spraying equipment hourly rate.  We will discuss with you which rate or rates will be applicable to your task. The majority of jobs are charged on a Ha basis, excluding complex jobs, lantana/parthenium weed spraying and jobs with weeds that are vastly spread out across the property. These types of jobs will be charged on an hourly basis.
