The XAG P100 drone has the ability to spray up to 10 Ha per hour depending on conditions. The drone has omnidirectional nozzles that ensure uniform spraying, reducing the risk of over or under-application. The downward rotor wash from the propellers agitates the crop surface which allows deep and even chemical coverage throughout the crop canopy. BushFlyers can complete tasks and cover more acres in less time, hence boosting productivity.
