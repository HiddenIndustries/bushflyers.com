When your country is too wet or too rocky for the use of traditional wheeled implements the XAG P100 drone can also be used for broader purposes such as seeding. The drone's advanced sensors and GPS technology are used to navigate large areas of land and drop seed with precision. This method is faster and more efficient than traditional methods, leading to increased productivity and reduced labour costs. XAG has a state of the art spreading system, incorporating industry leading vertical centrifugal spreading discs and a smart screw feeder. As a result, not only can the system adapt easily to various types of fertilisers and seed, it also reduces payload drifting.
