Drones have the capability of capturing aerial images and mapping areas in real-time, and the XAG P100 drone takes this to another level. This drone comes with a 16-megapixel camera that can capture high-quality images, providing farmers with accurate data on crop progress, growth, and signs of disease or pest infestation. This information allows farmers to make timely decisions and take preventive measures before it's too late. BushFlyers also operate the XAG M500 Remote Sensing Drone which is designed for precision agriculture, with the capability to fly autonomously and capture high definition images with high-performance data processing.
