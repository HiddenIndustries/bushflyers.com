    We can usually provide an estimate of costs without seeing your property in person but can also arrange a visit as part of a <span class="text-primary">no obligation, free quotation</span>.  In this phase, we will consult with you about what is required and the total area to be covered.
    <div class="text-offset text-xs">*Note â€“ all charges listed below do not include GST, which will be added. A 75% deposit of chemical costs will be required if we are suppling the chemicals. The remaining amount owing for the job will be invoiced on completion of work. If the area treated was larger or smaller than initially quoted, amendments will be made to the final invoice as required.</div>
